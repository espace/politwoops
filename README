= Setting up the app

* Create the databases in MySQL that you will need.
* Run "bundle install" to install all dependencies.
* Run "rake db:seed" to load in a default group.

= Loading in data

* Create a CSV where the second column is the Twitter ID or URL, the fifth column is the party, and the sixth column is the "group" (which can be "default").
* Run "rake csv:import CSV=[filename]" to import this CSV. Add "CSV_SEP=," if you need it to use a separator other than the semicolon.
